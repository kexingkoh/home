                        <p>While we have little control over this type of Luck, having said that, our ultimate Destiny is still a choice.</p>

                        <p>Earth Luck is specifically associated with Feng Shui. Earth luck is determined by the relationship between man and earth where it points to the influences of our location and where we lead our lives everyday.</p>
                        <p>Classical Feng Shui is based on The Five Element Theory and helps reduce the negative energy around us while harnessing the benevolent energy in our surroundings to bring us prosperity, harmony and joy.</p>

It is what we achieve through our education, our talents, our behaviour and the work we do to reach our goals.</p>
                        <p>Man Luck includes our cultural and religious beliefs as well as the moral codes that we stand by, the charities we get involved in and our willingness to help others and the environment around us.</p>
